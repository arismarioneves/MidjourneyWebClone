# MidjourneyWebClone
 
A fully functional HTML clone of the Midjourney web interface, designed to replicate the layout and functionality of the original site. This clone focuses on the basic structure and functionality of the interface, without including screen animations.

If anyone is curious about the animations, see this discussion I found on Stack Overflow: [How does the ASCII art on the Midjourney home page work?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76426202/how-does-the-ascii-art-on-the-midjourney-home-page-work).
